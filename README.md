- CSS
- JavaScript
- BEM convention
### **How to use it ?** 

- You can add your new task in the main panel.
- If you have completed the task, you can mark them as completed with the green button. The task will be crossed out, but you will still see it on your list.
- If a task is no longer valid, you can delete it using the trash can icon.
- After adding the first task, two new buttons will appear above the list of tasks: 
  - the first allows you to hide completed tasks,
  - the second allows you to mark all tasks as done.
